# PE03-todos

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The inputs to the code are users' inputs of different items that they need to do. Users are also able to select the status of the item via the "Done" button.</p>
<h1>Process</h1>
<p>User inputs are added to an array and sorted based on what is complete and what is not. Completed tasks get added to the Complete section and all inputs get logged in the console. App.js calls out the different components of the app being used (Button.js, Heading.js, TabBar.js, etc). Each one of the components control the state management / effects on each individual aspect of the app.</p>
<h1>Output</h1>
<p>The output is a user friendly array of tasks that can be sorted on what is complete and what is still left to do.</p>
